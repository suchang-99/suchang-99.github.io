## <span id="about">About Me</span>
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate at Institute of Software, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under the supervision of Prof. Fusang Zhang and Prof. Beihong Jin. 
In 2021, I got my bachelor's degree from Xiamen University.

Currently, my research focuses on using self-supervised learning and generative models to address the challenge of limited labeled data for human sensing tasks.

I am currently seeking internship opportunities for Summer 2026. Feel free to reach out.
